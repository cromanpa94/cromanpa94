# 😄 Hiya! 😄


## My research 🤔

I use statistics and bioinformatics to address questions at the interface between ecology and evolution. My research interests are generally related to phylogenetics, systematics, convervation biology, and the effects of climate change on biodiversity at different spatial and taxonomic scales! 

## Who am I? ☺️

I was born in the Colombian Andes (Armenia, Quindío) surrounded by stunning landscapes and amazing biodiversity! I received my bachelor's degree from Universidad del Valle, in Cali, Colombia, and Ph.D from the University of Arizona i Tucson. I am also very much into photography!
